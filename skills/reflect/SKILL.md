# Reflect

Mine the current conversation for durable learnings, then route them into skill edits.

## When to invoke

- The user said "reflect" or "/reflect".
- A complex task (5+ tool calls) just landed cleanly and the recipe is worth keeping.
- The agent hit dead ends, found the working path, and the path generalizes.
- The user corrected the agent's approach mid-task.
- A non-trivial workflow emerged that isn't captured anywhere.

Skip when the conversation is trivial, off-topic, or already covered by an existing skill the parent followed correctly. One-offs are not learnings.

## Process

### 1. Locate the active session

The agent finds its own session file before starting the passes. PI stores sessions as JSONL files under the session dir: `<session-dir>/<project>/<session>.jsonl`, one entry per message (same entry shape as the transcripts extension: `message.content` text parts). Resolve the session dir from the environment; never hardcode `~/.pi` paths.

```bash
SESSION_DIR="${PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR:-${PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR}/sessions}"
ls -t "$SESSION_DIR"/*/*.jsonl 2>/dev/null | head -10
```

Do not glob across other projects' session dirs. That crosses workspace boundaries and reads private chats from unrelated projects. Restrict the search to the current project's subdir (the `pstack_transcripts` extension tool resolves the current project automatically when present).

For each candidate, read the first JSONL entry and check that the entry's message text contains the conversation's opening user prompt. Take the matching path. If no path resolves, write a tight digest of the session and pass that instead.

### 2. Run three reviewers as one subagent fan-out

**Subagent fan-out (default).** When the `subagent` tool (pi-subagents) is present, launch the three lens reviewers with `workflowScript` `runs.all`, one run per lens. Each run names its role agent — `pstack-reflect-tooling`, `pstack-reflect-judgment`, `pstack-reflect-divergent` (role agents live in `agents/`) — pins an explicit `model`, sets `context: "fresh"`, and carries the lens template as the task. The role agents are non-writing: their prompts forbid file writes; the parent applies edits. Never pass `worktree` and never let a lens edit files.

| Lens | Role agent | Prompt template |
|---|---|---|
| Judgment | `pstack-reflect-judgment` | `references/judgment-reviewer.md` |
| Tooling | `pstack-reflect-tooling` | `references/tooling-reviewer.md` |
| Divergent | `pstack-reflect-divergent` | `references/divergent-reviewer.md` |

Resolve each run's `model` from `~/.pi/agent/pstack/models.md` (written by setup-pstack): the `reflect tooling` line for the tooling lens, the `reflect judgment, divergent, synthesizer` line for the judgment, divergent, and synthesizer runs. When a line is absent, use that role agent's pinned model (setup default). Every run pins an explicit model — never a slug you invented. If a configured value is `inherit-parent` or `auto`, use the role agent's pin and note it.

Pass each template verbatim as the task, substituting the session path or digest where marked. Lens runs are read-only: they may call MCP tools and read the codebase, never write.

```js
subagent({
  async: true,
  workflowScript: `
    const sessionPath = "<absolute session path or digest>";
    const results = await runs.all([
      { key: "judgment", agent: "pstack-reflect-judgment", model: "<resolved judgment model>", context: "fresh", task: "<references/judgment-reviewer.md with the session path substituted>" },
      { key: "tooling", agent: "pstack-reflect-tooling", model: "<resolved tooling model>", context: "fresh", task: "<references/tooling-reviewer.md with the session path substituted>" },
      { key: "divergent", agent: "pstack-reflect-divergent", model: "<resolved divergent model>", context: "fresh", task: "<references/divergent-reviewer.md with the session path substituted>" }
    ]);
    return results.map(r => ({ key: r.key, status: r.status, outputReference: r.outputReference }));
  `
})
```

Record which model each run resolved to, and whether the session went by path or digest. If a reviewer drops out or returns `BLOCKED`, proceed with the remaining lenses and note the gap when synthesizing; `runs.all` keeps sibling lanes running when one lane blocks or fails. If the user configured one model for all three lenses, note it: lens diversity is weaker with one model.

### 3. Synthesize (parent)

**Parent synthesis (default).** The parent performs the synthesis in its own session after the three lens reviewers return — do not launch a fourth subagent for it. Apply `references/synthesizer.md` verbatim, with each reviewer's full output inlined where marked. The quality check includes spot-verifying citations, which can require read-only context lookups (MCP or codebase). The synthesis returns a structured Accepted / Rejected / Backlog list; the parent owns the criteria judgments and the presentation to the user.

This pass is judgment work. Use your configured synthesize model (the `reflect judgment, divergent, synthesizer` line from `~/.pi/agent/pstack/models.md`; default: strongest judgment model (setup default)). If the session model differs from the configured synthesizer model, switch before synthesizing (`--model provider/id` on launch, or Ctrl+P to cycle), or note the mismatch after the synthesis.

### 4. Structural enforcement check

Sanity-check the synthesizer's Accepted list. For any item that would be enforced more reliably by a lint rule, script, metadata flag, or runtime check, move it from Accepted to Backlog. The synthesizer already applies this criterion; this is a final pass before edits land. See the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill.

### 5. Apply

Before applying any Accepted edit, present the synthesizer's full Accepted/Rejected/Backlog output to the user and wait for explicit approval. Ask in prose (there is no AskQuestion tool on PI); the user picks which subset to apply and may redirect routings. Skill changes affect every future agent; do not auto-apply.

Backlog items file to whatever devex / backlog tracker your team uses automatically. Those are tracker submissions, not skill edits. Only the Accepted list waits for approval.

For each approved Accepted item, follow the Routing field exactly:

- Trivial existing-skill edit (a one-line bullet, a tightened sentence, a stale fact corrected): the parent does directly.
- Substantive existing-skill edit (a new section, a new pattern table, more than ~10 lines): hand to the authoring-a-skill playbook (`poteto-mode/playbooks/authoring-a-skill.md`) and run its draft / test / iterate loop.
- `tune description: <skill path>` (the skill exists but didn't trigger when it should have): hand to the authoring-a-skill playbook and run its description-optimization loop.
- `new skill: <kebab-name>`: hand creation to the authoring-a-skill playbook. Do not invent the shape ad hoc.

If your environment ships a SKILL.md validator, run it on every touched skill before declaring done. Skip this step if it doesn't.

### 6. Summarize for the user

Short list, no preamble:

- Edits applied: `<skill path>`. What changed, one line each.
- New skills created: `<skill path>`. One line each (rare).
- Backlog filed to the devex tracker: `<issue title>` (`<tags>`). One line each.
- Dropped: one line per rejected finding + reason from the synthesizer.

**Fallback: sequential passes (used only when the `subagent` tool is absent).**

### 2. Run three reviewers as sequential passes

One session, three numbered passes, one per lens. Each pass reads the session and applies its lens; the user switches the session model before a pass to match its role (`--model provider/id` on launch, or Ctrl+P to cycle). Record which model each pass ran under. The prompts forbid file writes; the parent applies edits.

| Lens | `model` | Prompt template |
|---|---|---|
| Judgment | your configured reflect-judgment model (default: strongest judgment model (setup default)) | `references/judgment-reviewer.md` |
| Tooling | your configured reflect-tooling model (default: second-family model) | `references/tooling-reviewer.md` |
| Divergent | your configured reflect-judgment model (default: strongest judgment model (setup default)) | `references/divergent-reviewer.md` |

Pass each template verbatim, substituting the session path or digest where marked. Reviewers return findings in the pass output. If a configured model is `inherit-parent` or `auto`, run that pass on the current session model and note it. If the user keeps one model for all three passes, note it: lens diversity is weaker with one model.

### 3. Synthesize

One pass after the reviewers, using your configured reflect-judgment model (default: strongest judgment model (setup default)). The synthesizer's quality check includes spot-verifying citations, which can require context lookups. Use `references/synthesizer.md` verbatim, with each reviewer's full output inlined where marked. The synthesizer returns a structured Accepted / Rejected / Backlog list.
