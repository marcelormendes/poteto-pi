### Feature

**You own the design. Plan, review, verify.** Write the code as a subagent run on the feature role agent; stay in the lead.

1. `how` over the affected subsystem.
2. `architect` for design exploration. Skipping stays as `architect skipped: <reason>`; do not fold the design decision silently into implementation.
3. Write the throughput checkpoint as four `pstack_todo` items (four checklist lines when the tool is unavailable). A dimension that genuinely does not apply (single file, no fan-out) keeps its item with `n/a: <reason>` rather than being dropped:
   - **Blocking first steps.** Gates run before the workstreams.
   - **Independent workstreams.** Disjoint files, services, or layers run as separate passes. Shared writes serialize.
   - **Shared mutable state.** Default to splitting the target (the **separate-before-serializing-shared-state** principle skill). Serialize only for real invariants.
   - **Smallest safe decomposition.** If one pass is best, name why.
4. Launch the code-writing run through the `subagent` tool: `{ agent: "pstack-feature", model: <feature role model>, task: <the brief>, worktree: true, gate: <verify command>, timeoutMs: <budget> }`. The role agent is a writer: it gets an isolated git worktree and runs the gate before reporting back. Give it a specific scope (file paths, named data shape and its organizing structure per **principle-model-the-domain** — a state machine over scattered booleans, a table/registry over branching, a typed model over repeated shape assumptions, chosen before the run writes logic — and success criteria); review its diff before accepting it, never accept its summary on faith. Pin the feature role model from `~/.pi/agent/pstack/models.md` (managed by `setup-pstack`; fall back to the role's default, the fast mechanical model (setup default), never invent a model slug) and record which model ran the launch. When the implementation admits multiple valid shapes (error handling, abstraction layer, test structure), run it through the **arena** skill instead so the independent lanes surface the alternatives and the cross-judge guards the pick. Mandatory: no skip-with-reason escape, and Laziness Protocol does not override it (the gain is review separation, not lines saved). The launch owns the diff with the review as a separate subagent run before accept, so there is no "standing by" reply that waits on a helper. Comments per **Comments**. Surgical edits, re-ground against the source for upstream-derived files. Port shared-primitive improvements to all consumers and verify each. Commit liberally.
5. Verify on the matching surface. "Inconclusive" or wrong-surface is not a pass; flag it.
6. Rebase into small, ordered commits; stack follow-ups.
   Use the **sequence-verifiable-units** principle skill, building, verifying, and committing each small unit before the next.
7. If the design is contested, `interrogate` before shipping.
8. Run **Opening a PR**.

Code-coupled work (one feature, one migration) goes to a single owner with the checkpoint inline; that owner launches the internal workstreams sequentially after the blocking phase, one subagent run per workstream with each in its own worktree when they can collide (principle-separate-before-serializing-shared-state). Parent-level spans are for slices that produce independent artifacts (audits, cross-subsystem investigations, competing experiments). Rewrite the checkpoint at phase boundaries; start a fresh launch (fresh numbered pass in the fallback) rather than chaining interrupts.

**Fallback: sequential numbered passes (used only when the `subagent` tool is absent).** Run the same briefs inline and sequentially in this session, one numbered pass per delegated step, on the configured role models, per Passes in the skill. Same scope, same PASS/ISSUES/BLOCKED envelope, same dropout tolerance.

**Reply:** what you built, what you chose and why, open decisions. Tables for design alternatives.
