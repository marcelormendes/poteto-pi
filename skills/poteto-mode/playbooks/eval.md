### Eval

**You own the experiment design. Plan, blind, run, synthesize.**

Evals test how a change affects agent behavior before promoting it: a new skill variant, a structural change, a prompt tweak. The failure mode is the observer effect. An agent that knows it's being evaluated behaves differently, so candidates must run blind.

**Non-negotiables for blinding:**

- No `eval`, `test`, `judge`, `experiment`, `rubric`, `score`, `compare`, `benchmark`, `candidate`, or `arena` in any directory, file, or prompt the candidate sees.
- The candidate prompt looks like an organic user request. State the goal, not the meta. "build me a small todo cli" not "show me how you follow the principles chain".
- No chain-eliciting cues. Don't ask the candidate to list which skills, principles, or files they applied; that meta-prompt inflates citation behavior. Ask for design notes generally and grade chain-following from code shape, not self-report.
- Sanitize directory and slug names. Use project-shaped names a user might pick, not labels like `candidate-1` or `agent-a`.
- Don't tell the candidate other candidates exist.
- The judge can know it's judging but sees outputs by sanitized label only, never by model name.
- Comparing two variants: one judge scores both sets in a single pass on one scale, blind to which set each came from. Two judge runs with different prompts don't compare, the calibration drifts.

**Steps:**

1. **Frame.** State what variant is under test and what behavior counts as success. Write the rubric (3-6 concrete criteria) for the judge only. Hold it back from candidates.
2. **Set up sanitized environments.** Per-candidate working dir with the variant in place. Plant any context an organic task would have: a project skeleton, the skills the candidate would naturally read.
3. **Author one organic prompt.** What a user would type. No leakage of what's being measured.
4. **Launch N candidate passes** as one `subagent` `workflowScript` `runs.all` batch per the **arena** skill's Phase B, one lane per candidate: `{ key: "candidate-<n>", agent: "pstack-arena-runners-<n>", model: <seat model>, task: <the same organic prompt>, cwd: <sanitized dir>, timeoutMs: <budget> }`. Each works in its own sanitized dir (`cwd` per lane; the dirs sit at `/tmp/<slug>/candidate-<n>/`, never worktrees of one repo, because the variant differs per candidate). Same prompt to each. Pin each seat's model from `~/.pi/agent/pstack/models.md` (managed by `setup-pstack`; fall back to the seat's default, the arena-runners list order, never invent a model slug) so the panel crosses model families, and record which model each lane ran under. Fallback when the `subagent` tool is absent: run the candidate passes sequentially in this session, one numbered pass per candidate, switching the session model between passes.
5. **Run one blinded judge pass** on a different model family per the **arena** skill's Phase C as a read-only `subagent` run: `{ agent: "pstack-arena-cross-judges-<n>", model: <seat model>, task: <the judge brief pointing at the sanitized outputs>, cwd: <the outputs dir>, worktree: false }`. Pick the seat whose model family differs from every candidate's; pin its model from `~/.pi/agent/pstack/models.md` (fall back to the seat's default) and record it. The judge sees outputs by sanitized label and the rubric, never a model name. Fallback when the `subagent` tool is absent: run the judge pass as a numbered sequential pass in this session after switching the session model to the judge's family.
6. **Verify the chain from transcripts, not self-report.** Read each candidate's session transcript via the **pstack_transcripts** tool for this project. Do not read another project's transcripts; that crosses workspace boundaries and reads private chats from unrelated projects. Look at which files each candidate actually opened. Citing a principle is not reading its leaf skill, and reading it is not applying it. Grade chain-following from the files it really read plus the shape of the code, never from the candidate's own claims.
7. **Read every candidate output yourself** end to end. Compare to the judge's verdict. Disagreement means a model is biased or the rubric is ambiguous. Synthesize.

**Reply:** variant under test, rubric, per-candidate notes, judge's verdict, your synthesis, and a recommendation for whether to promote the variant.
